# Algorithm Analysis Laboratory Works

This repository contains laboratory works for the **Algorithm Analysis** course at the **Technical University of Moldova** (TUM).

## Structure

- **1_fibonacci_nth_term**: Implementations and performance analysis of various algorithms to compute the nth Fibonacci number.
- **2_sorting_algorithms**: Implementations and benchmarks of different sorting algorithms, including Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, and a Hybrid Sort.
- **345_graphs**: Benchmarks and implementations of algorithms on graphs: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Prim and Kruskal.
